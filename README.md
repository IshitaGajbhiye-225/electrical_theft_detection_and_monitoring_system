PROJECT TITLE - Real Time Electrical Theft Monitoring and Detection System using GSM Technology

INTRODUCTION - Electricity theft through meter tampering, illegal connections, and bypassing meters causes revenue losses and disrupts power supply management, leading to operational 
inefficiencies. The Electrical Power Theft Detection System is designed to identify unauthorized electricity usage, which results in significant financial losses. The ESP32 platform serves as the central controller that monitors various parameters of the electricity consumption. By using current sensors , the system continuously checks for discrepancies that might indicate illegal usage. When a theft is detected, the system immediately sends an alert via the GSM module, notifying the authorities about the suspicious activity. By using modern technologies like sensors, microcontrollers, and communication systems, our project aims to create an effective solution to curb electricity theft.

FEATURES - 1] Real-time current monitoring using ACS712 , 2] Theft detection based on current comparison , 3] Alert via GSM SMS , 4] LCD display output , 5] Expandable to auto cutoff or fault detection. 

HARDWARE COMPONENTS - ESP32 Microcontroller, ACS712 (5A) Current Sensors , SIM900A GSM Module , 20x4 I2C LCD , LM2596 Buck Converter , 7805 Voltage Regulator , DC Bulbs , Relay Module (optional for cutoff).

SOFTWARE USED - Arduino IDE , LiquidCrystal_I2C.h , Wire.h 

FUTURE SCOPE - 1] Auto power cutoff , 2] Android app interface , 3] Grid fault detection 

CONCLUSION - In conclusion , the proposed real-time electrical theft monitoring and detection system with a GSM technology showed good simulation results to identify if there is meter tampering and illegal connections in the power system network. The hardware project showed how the proposed system can practically monitor and detect any illegal electricity connections on the distribution feeders and meter tampering when a consumer manipulates its smart electric meter. It further showed how an SMS is sent to the registered number alerting the electric supply authority about the theft occurring. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed system will play a major role in detecting or alleviating power theft.
